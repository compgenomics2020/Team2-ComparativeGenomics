# Comparative Genomics
# Objective
*  We are going to do comparative genomic analysis, including Average Nucleotide Identity, SNP-based phylogenomics, and MLST.

# Installations and Setup
## ANI

## MLST

## SNP Typing
### Determining optimal value of k
### Creating phylogenetic tree
	kSNP3 -in <input_file> -k 13 -outdir <output_directory> -ML
