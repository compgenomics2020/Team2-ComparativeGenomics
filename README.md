# Comparative Genomics
# Objective
*  We are going to do comparative genomic analysis, including Average Nucleotide Identity, SNP-based phylogenomics, and MLST.

# Installations and Setup
## ANI
### Installing FastANI
### git clone https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI (Please install git first if you do not have it. For linux (sudo apt install git) and MacOS (brew install github, also install xcode-tools before you run brew))
#### This software requires c++11 to build, which is available in GCC >= 4.8 (on linux) and Clang >= 3.3 (on mac). It has the following denpendencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - either...
       GNU Scientific Library ( http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ )
     or..
       Boost Library ( http://www.boost.org ) (see "-with-boost" below)
   - Zlib ( included with OS X and most Linuxes, http://www.zlib.net ) *
   - C++ compiler with C++11 and openmp support
       Note for macOS users: Use "libomp" to link openmp with Clang
       libomp is available through brew ( https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libomp )
Configure Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure [--prefix=...] [--with-gsl=...] [--with-boost=...]
   make


Products:
---------
   - Executable fastANI
   
### tutorial
Produce help page. Quickly check the software usage and available command line options.
$ ./fastANI -h
One to One. Compute ANI between single query and single reference genome:
$ ./fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] -r [REFERENCE_GENOME] -o [OUTPUT_FILE] 
Here QUERY_GENOME and REFERENCE_GENOME are the query genome assemblies in fasta or multi-fasta format.

One to Many. Compute ANI between single query genome and multiple reference genomes:
$ ./fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] --rl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
For above use case, REFERENCE_LIST should be a file containing directory paths to reference genomes, one per line.

Many to Many. When there are multiple query genomes and multiple reference genomes:
$ ./fastANI --ql [QUERY_LIST] --rl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]


### FastANI wrapper

For our website, we will produce a python wrapper which used subprocess call to call FastANI, check input file, parameters passed to FastANI via the wrapper and also whether FastANI executable exist in the our conda working environment.

## MLST
### Installing MLST
	conda install -c bioconda mlst
### Running MLST

* We use the campylobacter scheme from PubMLST database for running the tool
* Input file format: Contig fasta files

	mlst --csv --legacy --scheme --campylobacter <input_fasta_file> > <mlst_output_csv>
* For our website we have a python wrapper script that checks the input files, output directory and calls MLST on the campylobacter scheme.
 
### Visualising MLST results for the website

#### We have a python scripts that creates a simple visualisation of the mlst results, depicting the STs detected and the sample names belonging to each ST
	python3 mlst_viz.py <mlst_output_csv> <output_directory>
## SNP Typing
### Installing Ksnp3.1
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/ksnp/files/kSNP3.1_Linux_package.zip
	unzip kSNP3.1_Linux_package.zip
* Input file format: <path/to/isolate_n.fasta> \t <isolate_ID>
	kSNP3 â€“in <input_file> -k 25 outdir <output_directory> -ML
#### Next, the source code needs to be modified to allow local access without sudo permissions

### Determining optimal value of k
#### First, the ksnp program kSNP3.1_Linux_package/kSNP/jellyfish must be exported to $PATH and copied to usr/bin
#### Next, a copy of the text file with all the paths to fasta files must be created
#### Run MakeFasta with text file as input and name of output file to concatenate all inputs to a single fasta
	MakeFasta <input_file.txt> <output_file.fasta>
#### Run Kchooser on generated fasta file
	Kchooser <all_genomes.fasta>
#### If optimal K is 31, the`n K likely plateaued at a specific percentage. Check Kchooser.report and rerun with asymptotic percentage as cutoff (ex. 95.8%)
	Kchooser <all_genomes.fasta> 0.958
### Creating phylogenetic tree
	kSNP3 -in <input_file> -k 25 -outdir <output_directory> -ML
